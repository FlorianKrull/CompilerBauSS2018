# Assignment 4 -- Recursive Descent Parser

*due on 6 June 2018*

## Task 1

- Implement a handwritten recursive descent parser (+ lexer).

Your handwritten lexer and parser should directly replace the current lexer and parser, generated by `flex` / `bison`.
Ideally you should not have to touch any other part of the code-base than the parser.
The parser interface should stay exactly the same (`parser.h`).

## Task 2

Do not discard the *old* parser from your code-base.
Add a switch to your build system (generator) which allows one to switch between the generated and handwritten parser at compile time.
